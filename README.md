- Search and Filters: The system enables searching and filtering of judicial processes based on specific criteria such as process number, involved parties, status, and others, facilitating the location of relevant information.-

- Access Control: The project implements an authentication and access control system to ensure that only authorized users can perform CRUD operations on judicial processes. Different levels of permissions can be configured for users, ensuring information security.

- User-Friendly Interface: The system features an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making navigation and interaction with the judicial process CRUD functionalities simple and easy to use.

This repository is an excellent foundation for developers interested in building or contributing to judicial process management systems in PHP, utilizing MySQL for database management, HTML and CSS for frontend design, and JavaScript for interactive elements. It enables rapid implementation of a complete CRUD, while being highly customizable and extensible to meet the specific needs of different legal contexts.
